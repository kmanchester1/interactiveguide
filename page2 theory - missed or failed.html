This might include, for example, serious illness or distressing personal issues (e.g. bereavement). It is important that you tell someone at the University as soon as you can about any such issues so you can get the advice and support you need.</a>

                <a href="#">If you had good cause for missing a deadline then you can submit for extenuating circumstances (ECs). In this scenario, you should also complete an Extenuating Circumstances form online from your eVision account. This should be submitted no later than 7 days after your assessment was due to take place and should include evidence of your circumstances (e.g. a doctorâ€™s note).</a>
