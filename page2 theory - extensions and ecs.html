This might include, for example, serious illness or distressing personal issues (e.g. bereavement). <br><br>It is important that you tell someone at the University as soon as you can about any such issues so you can get the advice and support you need.<br><br>As soon as an issue arises, let your module leader and your personal academic tutor (PAT) know.
